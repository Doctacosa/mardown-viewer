This is a simple Markdown viewer meant to display the content of multiple .md files.

The syntax in use follows the CommonMark spec with the GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions.


## Installation

Then, place all of the Markdown files, with `.md` extensions, in the `notes/` subdirectory.

And that's it!
